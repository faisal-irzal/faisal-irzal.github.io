Several machine learning models will be demonstrated in this post to predict electrical energy production from a power plant based on environmental and control features. Exploratory Data Analysis will be conducted to find correlations of each features to the target variable. Results of the trained models will be compared and the best model will be further used to recommend some exemplary energy market actions.

### Introduction: Business Problem 

To ensure a steady supply of electricity to consumers, energy suppliers owning electric power plants should produce and place the right amount of electricity on the grid at every moment to instantaneously meet and balance electricity demand. To this end, it is important for them to know in advance how much power output they can produce by taking into account certain parameters, and how much the current market price in such way they can maximize the profit of selling the produced electricity.

This Notebook will focus on a combined cycle power plant, which consists of gas turbines, steam turbines, and heat recovery steam generators. In this type of plant, the electricity is generated by gas and steam turbines combined in one cycle. Then, it is transferred from one turbine to another. While the vacuum is collected from and has an effect on the steam turbine, the ambient variables affect the gas turbine performance.

This example aims to model the energy generated as a function of exhaust vacuum and ambient variables and use that model to predict the output performance of the plant.
